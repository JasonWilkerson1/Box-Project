        <p className="content-body">A Family Sponsor communicates directly with a family in need by writing letters, offering friendship and sending a box of basic need items (and perhaps a special treat!) once a month for a minimum of ___ months. For someone who struggles to get by day-to-day, the extra support and genuine connections that our sponsors provide has a drastic and meaningful impact on their lives.

        <p className="content-body">The holiday season is a difficult time for Box Project families. Luxuries that many people take for granted, such as being able to host family members for meals to celebrate special family traditions or buying a brand new pair of shoes for your daughter, become unique challenges for families living in rural poverty. A lot of times the holidays represent a time of financial stress where families are stuck between making ends meet to grant their child’s holiday wish and surviving. With your help, the obstacles faced by families during the winter holiday may not seem so large. Sponsor a family today and help make a difference this holiday season.
          Family matches are made during October and November.

        <p className="content-body">Back-to-School can be a challenging time for The Box Project families while they are on our waiting list for a long-term sponsor. How can you help a child have a great start to a new school year? The Box Project offers a one-time, short-term opportunity for you to sponsor a family for the Back-to-School season. You can help a family by buying school supplies, uniforms and/or other important items necessary for a smooth start to the new school year.
          School starts in early August, and we match families in June and July.
